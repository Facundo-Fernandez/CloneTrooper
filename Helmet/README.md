# Clone Helmet Files
### Please Read Before Downloading 3D File
Repository for Clone Helmet 3D parts and Code as Requested. 

In this repository you will find all part used in my helmet videos (click image above).  The electronics portion is in it's own folder. I only upload files usually when people ask for them, so if you watched a video and want something you don't see here just ask. 

NOTE: These files were built by me for my personal use.  I'm happy to share them with anyone who wants them but they are as they are and will won't be edited.  They may work, they may not.  I tend to print things "quick and dirty" and fix them later.  Good luck, message me with any questions.
